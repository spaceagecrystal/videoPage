# Video Page

## What it is

Often I need a very quick presentation of a video devoid of an existing CMS or anything other than a web server and a directory. There are a ton of services out there that can do this, but this is for very rapidly needed quick turnarounds. 

Its based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [MediaElement.js](http://http://mediaelementjs.com/)

Use it as is to display a single video, or use it as a starting point for something more.
