# Video Page

## What it is

Often I need a very quick presentation of a video, or series of videos for client or group review. There are many services out there that can do this, but this is for quick turnarounds when you just have a LAMP stack.

* The videos are automatically centered by jQuery, so the only place you need to enter the video dimensions are in the video element itself.

* The index page uses php to produce a linked list of html files in the directory.

* Aside from the video positioning, there is no styling, so you can skin to requirements.

* Its based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [MediaElement.js](http://http://mediaelementjs.com/)
